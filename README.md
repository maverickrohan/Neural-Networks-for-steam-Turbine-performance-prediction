# Neural Network for Steam Turbine Efficiency Prediction 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This MATLAB project builds a **Neural Network (ANN)** to predict the **efficiency of a steam turbine** based on key thermodynamic parameters like **pressure, temperature, and mass flow rate**.

The model helps in optimizing **Rankine cycle performance** using **machine learning** instead of traditional thermodynamic equations.

## 📂 Features
✅ Loads and processes **real-world turbine data**  
✅ Builds a **Feedforward Neural Network (ANN)** with **MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox**  
✅ **Predicts turbine efficiency** with high accuracy  
✅ Visualizes **actual vs predicted performance**  
✅ Uses **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for evaluation**
